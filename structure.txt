# Rebel Flagship
# Throughout the game, stage 1 is set as the pending boss.
# When it is defeated, the number of crew in each room are counted to
# carry over into the next stage.
#
# Stage 1 sets the crew occupancy, but doesn't read it.
# Fleeing stage 1, altering these bytes, then returning
# only results in a fresh fight.
#
# Upon first engaging stage 2, the layout is migrated.
# The previous occupancy list is truncated to the new layout's
# room count. (The blueprints happen to have matching low roomIds.)
#
#   Stage 1: 0x13=19 rooms
#   Stage 2: 0x0F=15 rooms
#   Stage 3: 0x0B=11 rooms
#   Having 0 rooms occupied is allowed, meaning AI took over.
#
# Stage 2 will read altered bytes on additional skirmishes.
# Stage 3 probably will, too. (unconfirmed)
